        When he wasn't coding, he still kept busy. Those closest to him cited a strong interest in
        video games, sparked at the age of 4. The controller became a compass. It's no surprise he
        gravitated towards technology. Systems fascinated him. Another medium of escapism came
        through reading. Horror, thrillers, fantasy, anything that allowed him to experience another
        reality. At night, his gaze turned upwards. Plans were made to obtain a telescope and
        explore the quiet vastness of the cosmos. Often, he put his imagination to paper. His
        earliest sketches date back to high school. Pastel, colored pencils, charcoal, acrylic, and
        pen, he tried it all. He kept coming back to watercolors - deliberate, messy, and demanding
        control. But he found beauty in the chaos. We've recovered some of his pieces, artifacts
        that might offer a glimpse into a restless mind.
