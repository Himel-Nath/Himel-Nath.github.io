        Sources say SimplyCast was seeking for a brilliant mind still early in development. They
        found him. Within weeks, he was already speaking the team's lingo, diagnosing bugs,
        navigating the codebase and improving the platform. His supervisor reported that he
        <strong>completed 34 tasks, more than anyone else that term</strong>, often asking for
        additional work. We were able to scavenge these remarks from the Co-Op appraisal report:

        “Himel is a highly productive worker and exceeded all my expectations for quality and
        quantity of work from a student on his co-op term. He shows great problem-solving skills, a
        keen desire to learn, and has a great work ethic. He would do well in pretty much any web
        development job.”

        They weren't wrong. It was never supposed to be permanent. But when he left, something had
        already been set in motion. They had plans for him and he had unfinished business.

        He returned to SimplyCast after his graduation, but this time not as an intern. He picked up
        where he left off, fixing bugs, big and small. But the stakes had changed. He tackled
        customer-impacting and time-sensitive issues. Within weeks, critical issues became routine.
        Two months in, <strong>he was promoted to a supervisor role.</strong> He overlooked two
        teams - 4 students, across 8 months.
