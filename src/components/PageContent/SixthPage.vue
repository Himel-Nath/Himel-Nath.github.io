        Configuring mini-PCs, gathering client requirements, and supporting connectivity for several

        Beneath it, he constructed Flask endpoints to support these features, each with its own set
        of test cases. One such feature was Google Analytics, which was woven right into the
        platform to track behaviorial data pulled from social media. Colleagues mentioned he was
        deeply involved within the agile cycle, contributing to story point estimates, code reviews,
        and running daily scrum meetings.
