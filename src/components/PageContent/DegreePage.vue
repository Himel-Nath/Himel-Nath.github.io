        His professors and dean took notice of his performance, awarding him the
        <strong>Sexton Scholar</strong> designation multiple times for maintaining a
        <strong>GPA above 3.85.</strong> Shown here is a certificate recognizing him for the
        <strong>highest CGPA</strong> in his cohort. Final year allowed him to explore different
        realms by choosing Network Security, Cloud Computing and Cryptography as his electives. He
        graduated with a <strong>certificate in Cybersecurity</strong> to complement his degree. But
        that wasn't all. When others chose easy electives, he pursued a
        <strong>minor in Mathematics</strong>. Courses like Advanced Linear Algebra, Ordinary
        Differential Equations, and Multivariable Calculus fed a passion he never let go of. His
        academic record closed with a <strong>CGPA of 4.16</strong> despite not having written a
        single line of code before University. If that doesn't make him dangerous, it makes him
        unpredictable. And in this case, that might be worse.
