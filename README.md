# Portfolio

Hello! I created this portfolio to display my Web Development skills. I've made backend and full-stack applications in the past but never focused on a complete frontend app. This is written entirely in Vue. It includes my background, hobbies, projects, experience, and my own personality. It works best on desktop. Also keyboard navigation is supported. Feel free to click all the buttons and experiment with the hidden features!
